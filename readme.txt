A HTML5 and Javascript game in which stuffed toy monkeys
mounted on cuddly birds battle it out with pencils for lances.

Oh yes. It's that silly.

We're still a way from version 0.1 yet really. Which is
when we'll have "Level One" ready to play. Here's the
stuff I intend to do before "release" day on the first
of June.

*) Player never dies. He gets knocked off his mount and
   falls down a long way perhaps, but he never *dies* as
   such.

*) Unmounted Meanies fall off map. Usually, at least,
   we don't want them to be running about on the floor
   the way they do at the moment.

*) Make a better level layout

*) Ideally more balloon graphics/colours\

*) Spend some more time improving collision detection.
   God damn I hate collision detection. There's always
   some case that doesn't bloody work properly.

*) Intro animation:
   *) Add a pink-monkey character
   *) Start with player and PM loving each other
   *) Meanie comes and kidnaps PM
   *) Monkey jumps onto nearby parrot, grabs a lance and gives chase.

*) Trap cursor-keys so we don't keep scrolling the page
   as we try and jump.

*) Improve the look of the index.html page some.

*) Note "Level End" at top of map, link to index2.html

*) joustadvenutre.dalliance.net to contain the project,
   not just link to commons hostage page.

*) Index2.html to contain a page describing plan for level2,
   and link to commons hostage page to pay for more dev
   work.

*) Better "Die" animation

*) Update Readme to describe game and funding process
