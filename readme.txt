A HTML5 and Javascript game in which stuffed toy monkeys
mounted on cuddly birds battle it out with pencils for lances.

Oh yes. It's that silly.

We're still a way from version 0.1 yet really. Which is
when we'll have "Level One" ready to play. Here's the
stuff I intend to do before "release" day on the first
of June. How much of it will get done? Have a weekend,
and a bank holiday. During which I also have one
all night party. So. We'll see.

*) Note "Level End" at top of map, link to index2.html

*) Trap cursor-keys so we don't keep scrolling the page
   as we try and jump. Or use different keys I guess.

*) Index2.html to contain a page describing plan for level2,
   and link to commons hostage page to pay for more dev
   work.

*) Better "Die" animation

*) Ideally more balloon graphics/colours

*) Spend some more time improving collision detection.
   God damn I hate collision detection. There's always
   some case that doesn't bloody work properly.

*) Update Readme to describe game and funding process
