* I mean I'm sure there's bugs and all, and there's plenty of features not done yet *
* but I've done a month's spare-time work on it and that's quite enough for now .   *
*                                                                                   *
* Level Two will be made and released only if anyone wants to actually pay me for   *
* this stuff. I mean if nobody cares enough to buy me a beer then I'm sure I've got *
* other things I can be getting on which that'll be just as much fun and someone    *
* *might* wanna buy me a beer for. Mmmmm. Beer. Hence the Commons Hostage, which    *
* you can find at http://commonshostage.com where my tip jar lives. Really. You     *

* And there's more to come, much of which is only very loosely planned right now,   *
* but the pattern here is clear: increasing price for each subsequent level. There  *
* are less than 20 levels. I reserve the right to change my mind about plot and     *
* code as we go along, and I reserve the right to discount the pricing if I wanna.  *
* And indeed to do anything I damned well please, pretty much.                      *
*                                                                                   *
