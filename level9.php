      <h2>Donations Needed</h2>
      <p>Thanks for playing previous levels.</p>
      <p>The story continues in this next part</p>
      <p>Featuring: More things! To be announced.</p>
      <p>It'll be released in the evening of the first Wednesday 
         of the month after the previous level was released, <b>if and only if</b>, 
         our donations bucket has received enough donations.</p>
      <p>That's right, if people can chip in enough money to get
         this project free, then the <i>the whole world</i> can play the next level.</p>
      <p>Subsequent levels will have more features, at higher
         costs. More narrative, multi-player abilities, sound
         effects, more graphics and exciting jousting gameplay.</p>
      <p>Check <a href="http://joustadventure.commonshostage.com/">Our Page At The Commons Hostage</a> 
         to see how donations are going and chip in a few coins
         towards the release of the next level.</p>
