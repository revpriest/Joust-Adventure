A game. Which plays like Joust.

Phase one: A spectrum-joust-a-like, you vs some AI bots, 
           four or so on a screen at once, whoever has the
           highest dagger wins.

Phase two: Multi-player. The other players in the game are
           others sat at home, if they use the right password
           then in the same game as a friend.

           Maybe there's a 'talk' mode.

Phase Three: Joust Adventure.
           We add a scrolly map, which means you're now in
           co-operative mode. Team up with friends to fight
           the evil-joust-bird menace. And it's like a 
           scrolly joust-em-up.

Phase four plus:
           New adventures, coz we now have 'levels' after all.

-----------------

Current Bugs:

*) Collision. We can only hit one thing at a time,
   so walking along a block (and so colliding with
   it's top) prevents us from being blocked by
   a block we walk into.
